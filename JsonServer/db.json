If you live in or have traveled through the Northwest part of The Commonwealth, you\u2019ve likely heard of, or been the victim of her cruelty.\r\n        That all changed several days ago.\r\n        Trashcan Carla, a caravan owner that frequents that area, reported hearing gunfire coming from the old US Air Force facility.\r\n        Now normally that wouldn\u2019t be much news, as Raiders tend to solve all their disputes with gunfire, but the sheer volume of fire caught her attention.\r\n        The following morning she told me she decided to have a look, and what she found was a rather uncomfortable.\r\n        I wont go into the details of what she found, but suffice to say, Ack-Ack and her war band wont be troubling anyone ever again.\r\n        Silly hairstyle aside, Ack-Ack was no pushover.\r\n        Be careful out there, Commonwealthers."

Its also no secret that his forces had been moving west, and had moved into Concord as well.\r\n        Some here in Diamond City had feared he was on a path to gathering enough men and women that he would soon be an actual threat to The Great Green Jewel.\r\n        While many would see that as fatalism, and that nothing can breach our walls, the point is now moot.\r\n        A very brave scaver of my acquaintance tell me that she was attempting to sneak into Lexington under the cover of a Rad Storm. She had designs to look for salvage in the old Super Duper Mart.\r\n        While she was unsuccessful in that (too many Ghouls in the area) she tells me that as the storm passed, she saw a single, blood splattered figure emerge from the assembly plant with a equally macabre painted Mr Handy in tow.\r\n        She wisely stayed out of sight, and quickly left the city.\r\n        What happened inside, and who this mysterious figure could be remain a topic for speculation.\r\n        There can be no question, however, that Lexington has been very quiet of late.\r\n        Be careful out there, Commonwealthers."

She claims not to eat little children, or drink the blood of the weak.\r\n        When asked about all the places she has reportedly been, and the body count the rumors credit her with, she simply replied, War Never Changes.\r\n        I know this has created more questions than it answers, but at least we have a name.\r\n        Perhaps we will learn more in the days to come."

      "story": "In a report that closely resembles the one a few weeks ago about yellow robots attacking anything in their path, a rumor claims a new raider faction has been spotted in the western reaches of the Commonwealth.\r\n        They identify themselves as the Rust Devils, and would not be all that noteworthy from other raiders, but for the fact that they seem to have experts in robotics in their ranks, as every siting has included mention of gruesome Protectron or Assaultron robots.\r\n        Some have suggested, often around a bottle of Bobrov Vodka, that they are the solders of The Valkyrie. They go on to say that she is often seen in the company of that odd Mr Handy, and has a habit of leaving a large body count in her wake as well.\r\n        While both those facts are undeniably true, I don\u2019t believe this is a fair claim.\r\n        For one thing, The Valkyrie has, as far as we know, only killed raiders, gunners and triggermen.\r\n        Our own Piper Wright and Nick Valentine claim, while obviously a little unhinged, they don\u2019t believe she would kill innocent people. At least not without being provoked.\r\n        No, while the Commonwealth\u2019s newest and most interesting resident may be many things, I don\u2019t believe a raider warlord is one of them."
