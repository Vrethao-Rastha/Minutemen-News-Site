If you live in or have traveled through the Northwest part of The Commonwealth, you’ve likely heard of, or been the victim of her cruelty.\r\n        That all changed several days ago.\r\n        Trashcan Carla, a caravan owner that frequents that area, reported hearing gunfire coming from the old US Air Force facility.\r\n        Now normally that wouldn’t be much news, as Raiders tend to solve all their disputes with gunfire, but the sheer volume of fire caught her attention.\r\n        The following morning she told me she decided to have a look, and what she found was a rather uncomfortable.\r\n        I wont go into the details of what she found, but suffice to say, Ack-Ack and her war band wont be troubling anyone ever again.\r\n        Silly hairstyle aside, Ack-Ack was no pushover.\r\n        Be careful out there, Commonwealthers."

She had designs to look for salvage in the old Super Duper Mart.\r\n        While she was unsuccessful in that (too many Ghouls in the area) she tells me that as the storm passed, she saw a single, blood splattered figure emerge from the assembly plant with a equally macabre painted Mr Handy in tow.\r\n        She wisely stayed out of sight, and quickly left the city.\r\n        What happened inside, and who this mysterious figure could be remain a topic for speculation.\r\n        There can be no question, however, that Lexington has been very quiet of late.\r\n        Be careful out there, Commonwealthers."

They go on to say that she is often seen in the company of that odd Mr Handy, and has a habit of leaving a large body count in her wake as well.\r\n        While both those facts are undeniably true, I don’t believe this is a fair claim.\r\n        For one thing, The Valkyrie has, as far as we know, only killed raiders, gunners and triggermen.\r\n        Our own Piper Wright and Nick Valentine claim, while obviously a little unhinged, they don’t believe she would kill innocent people. At least not without being provoked.\r\n        No, while the Commonwealth’s newest and most interesting resident may be many things, I don’t believe a raider warlord is one of them."
